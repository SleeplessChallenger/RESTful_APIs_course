<h2>RESTful APIs</h2>

I covered this course to get a better understanding of APIs construction.
In this particular case I did them with the help of `Flask`

- There are folders where you can see so-called `views` with `endpoints`
- in some folders there are also makeshift tests to verify our API working
- Regarding database, I used `SQLAlchemy` and pertinent files are named `models`
